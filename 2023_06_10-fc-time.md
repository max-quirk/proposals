## Summary

1. Move to bi-weekly funding cycles (every 2 weeks)
2. Reconfigure next funding cycle to start at one of the following times:

## Motivations

- With more Peel contributors about to be located in different timezones, perhaps we can select an FC time that works for everyone.
- More closely mimic JBDAO funding
- Decrease admin burden on all Peel contributors (wrote some about this [here](https://aeolian.eth.limo/8B76BCB9-5471-4657-9162-39AFDEF64628/))

## Risks

- there's no perfect FC time that will please everyone.
- bi-weekly means potentially missing out on dollar-cost-averaging benefits (for those keeping their payout in ETH).
- contributor personal cashflow may be affected
