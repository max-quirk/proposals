# Proposal for 3 funding cycle recurring payment renewal


 ## Retrospect

++ Over the past two funding cycles, i have been able to come up with three different wireframe iterations for the Websit+ - Assisted the efforts of the frontend team in terms of giving design opinions on basic feature implementation..+ - iterating on ways to clarify product accessiblity problems and give solutions on how it will be solved.
 - I have suggested UX Fixes of some features that are currently being worked on
 - reviewed the User researcher documentation, on the usability studies carried out on the Website on how to simplify technical concepts on the Landing page.

 ## Proposal
 
 I am proposing that my recurring payout be extended for the next 3 funding cycles at $1800/FC

 ## Rationale
 I am currently working on the Homepage redesign and need little more time to sytheize the UX findings of the User testing phase.
  And also the User heatmaps to make the Layout and information archeitecture simplitistic which has to align with the JB values.

 ### Responsibilities

 Going forward, I'll be responsible for the following:

 Redesigning the Homepage
 Mobile optimization of the JB product
 UX Enhancements
 User research on the JB new products in the pipeline and also the conducting user interviews to suggest quick UI fixes.

 I am also fully available to tackle some basic UI/UX product fixes that will readily arise for the product team. And also to work with the design team on the roadmap features that have already been laid out.
 And i will be helping for strategic concepts in designing the JB simplified frontends
