## Synopsis

Increase payout to Coda Labs (Coda Labs Ops Pty Ltd).

## Specification

Increase codalabs.eth payout from 4k to 5k per FC, until 2023-12-18 (roughly the next Peel renewal). See [note](#note).

## Rationale

Peel approved Coda Labs for the following scope of work, currently active (https://github.com/peeldao/proposals/blob/main/proposals/2023-05-20_coda-labs-renewal.md):
- tech leadership
  - provide guidance on Juicebox Protocol integration work (including future versioning efforts)
  - provide project implementation and rollout guidance
  - provide code reviews where necessary (and other ad-hoc guidance)
  - deliver features, bug fixes or other improvements at the discretion of Coda Labs or by negotiation.

Coda Labs proposes to expand their scope and commit to the following:
- Build, release and maintain a stable juice-sdk
  - It has been started here https://github.com/tomquirk/juice-hooks
  - this is somewhat necessary for rapid dApp development.
  - it would include various juicebox-related utilities necessary for juicebox frontends.
- Take full responsibility of JBM versioning work and improvements.
  - This will continue to be a Peel/JBM mandate, no matter future Peel direction.
- Re-join on-call bug efforts, with a 72 hour response time.
  - aeolian from Coda Labs has stepped in to fix some recent critical bugs.
  - Keeping on top of bugs is critical for Peel to maintain trust with the community.
  - More bug-fixing capacity is necessary.

**Budget**
- Peel has 3k unused budget
- If this proposal is approved, Peel would have 2k unused budget.

#### Note
- depending on the outcome of the next Peel proposal, Coda Labs is open to renegotiating this proposal to best contribute to the future direction.
